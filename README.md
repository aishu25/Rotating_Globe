# Rotating Globe
The Globe uses d3.js to rotate around its axis. When you hover over the countries , the names of the countries are displayed. 
When you click over a country the rotation stops for sometime and later starts back. You can rotate it in which ever direction
you need and the rotation continues in the direction its turned into.
